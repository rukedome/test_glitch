        <h1>Grilled Cheese Sandwich Recipe</h1>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h5>1. 2 ounces sliced melting cheese (American, Cheddar, Muenster, Havarti, Swiss, Fontina, Mozzarella, Monterey Jack, Pepper Jack, Provolone)</h5>
        <h5>2. 2 slices bread (White, Rye, Brioche, Sourdough, Potato, Whole Wheat, Pumpernickel)</h5>
        <h5>3. 1 tablespoon fat (Mayonnaise, Butter, Olive Oil, Chili Oil, Coconut Oil)</h5>
    
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Oven Method (Great for a Crowd of Six or Fewer):</h3>
        <h5>Put a rimmed baking sheet on the middle rack of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Make one sandwich per person: Sandwich 2 slices of cheese between 2 slices of bread. Spread or brush the outside of the sandwich with 1 tablespoon of fat. Place on the preheated baking sheet and cook until the cheese starts to melt, about 5 minutes. Flip the sandwich and bake until golden brown, an additional 5 minutes.</h5>
    
        <h3>Panini Press Method (For Crispy Crunchy Sandwich That Needs Minimal Attention):</h3>
        <h5>Sandwich 2 slices of cheese between 2 slices of bread. Preheat a panini press to medium heat. Spread or brush the outside of the sandwich with 1 tablespoon of fat and place in the press. Close the top and cook until lightly browned and the cheese is melted, 5 to 6 minutes.</h5>
    
        <h3>Skillet Method (Fool-Proof and Low-Tech):</h3>
        <h5>Sandwich 2 slices of cheese between 2 slices of bread. Preheat a skillet over medium-low heat. Spread or brush the outside of the sandwich with 1 tablespoon of fat and cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the sandwich, and continue cooking until browned and the cheese is melted, 3 to 4 minutes more.</h5>
