        <h1>Grilled Cheese Sandwich Recipe</h1>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ounces sliced melting cheese (American, Cheddar, Muenster, Havarti, Swiss, Fontina, Mozzarella, Monterey Jack, Pepper Jack, Provolone)</li>
            <li>2 slices bread (White, Rye, Brioche, Sourdough, Potato, Whole Wheat, Pumpernickel)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fat (Mayonnaise, Butter, Olive Oil, Chili Oil, Coconut Oil)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p><strong>Oven Method (Great for a Crowd of Six or Fewer):</strong></p>
        <p>Put a rimmed baking sheet on the middle rack of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F. Make one sandwich per person: Sandwich 2 slices of cheese between 2 slices of bread. Spread or brush the outside of the sandwich with 1 tablespoon of fat. Place on the preheated baking sheet and cook until the cheese starts to melt, about 5 minutes. Flip the sandwich and bake until golden brown, an additional 5 minutes.</p>

        <p><strong>Panini Press Method (For Crispy Crunchy Sandwich That Needs Minimal Attention):</strong></p>
        <p>Sandwich 2 slices of cheese between 2 slices of bread. Preheat a panini press to medium heat. Spread or brush the outside of the sandwich with 1 tablespoon of fat and place in the press. Close the top and cook until lightly browned and the cheese is melted, 5 to 6 minutes.</p>

        <p><strong>Skillet Method (Fool-Proof and Low-Tech):</strong></p>
        <p>Sandwich 2 slices of cheese between 2 slices of bread. Preheat a skillet over medium-low heat. Spread or brush the outside of the sandwich with 1 tablespoon of fat and cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the sandwich, and continue cooking until browned and the cheese is melted, 3 to 4 minutes more.</p>

        <h2>Great Combos:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pepper Jack and Sourdough, brushed with Chili Oil</li>
            <li>American and White Bread, brushed with Butter</li>
            <li>Swiss and Rye, brushed with Mayo</li>
            <li>Cheddar and Brioche, brushed with Butter</li>
        </ol>
