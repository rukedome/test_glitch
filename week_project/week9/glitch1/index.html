      As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself
      transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was lying on his hard,
      as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he
      could see his dome-like brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on
      top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to
      slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin
      compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes.
